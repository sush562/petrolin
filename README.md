# PetrolIn
This is a Flutter app I designed and developed to showcase my skills as a Flutter developer and mobile architect.

This app is a simple, offline vehicle refueling recorder. Users can record the refueling events of their vehicles so that they can keep track of their fuel expenses. It's a simple utility app related to fuel management.

For the architecture design of the project, I used clean architecture in conjunction with the Riverpod Library. I ensured the classes and files were arranged in the layered format pertaining to clean architecture and Riverpod acts as a dependency injection among the layers. Please feel free to go through the code.

I have released the app on google playstore. Please do download it and let me know of any improvements.

Below are some snapshots of the app:<br>

# petrolin
This is a flutter app designed to keep track of fuel consumption

This is a development app for my practice in flutter. It helps users to record refueling events by entering the amount, date of refueling, cost per liter of fuel and fuel type.

This is an offline app and uses no data of user from device or online as such. Please note that this app is developed independently and does not represent any company. Therefore, I assume no liability for any issues that may arise from its use.

I will be constantly improving the app overtime, adding new features.

Below are some snapshpts of the app:<br>
